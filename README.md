I'll update the readme later with a full formated doc but for now this will have to do!

But essentially you want to head into 3 main areas

--------------------

src/app.tsx

This is where all the HTML for the side is laid out. I wrote it mainly in HTML purely to make it easier and local for beginners in the space.

--------------------

src/usersettings.tsx

This is where you can control the UI of the minting machine. There are currently coloring options but I will add these at a later date.

--------------------

src/index.css

To make this more beginner friendly I've moved most of the main CSS values into CSS variables which can be changed in the :root area at the start of the document. These are mainly coloring and small UI tweaks and I don't think you'll be able to break to much here.
